# Intro To Deep Learning - Learning the use of Tensorflow and Keras

## Single Neuron 
- Deep learning is an approach to machine learning characterized by deep stacks of computation. the depth of computation has enabled deep learning models to break the complex and challenging real world data sets. Single Neuron is a linear unit (building block) that can have some input(s) and outup(s). the formulla `y = wx+b` depicts the working of a neuron. while w in the input x is the qty of input and b is bias value and y is the output. In case of mutliple inputs the formulla will look like this: `y = w0x0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + b`. while w0,w1,w2,w3 are different inputs.  Easiest way to create models in Keras is Keras.Sequential.
